#The Python print statement is often used to output variables.To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:
#Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
#Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.

################Rules for Python variables:######################
#A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#A variable name cannot start with a number
#A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
#Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
